			main tasks were resolving invoicing problems, processing refunds, investigating damage cases, loyalty program issues, and partially traffic

			<h2>At Your Service Assistant</h2><br/>
			<p>As a co-worker of the AYS team I provided help and service to the management working on the petrol-stations. My responsibility was first
			and foremost to monitor the so called purchase-to-pay processes via SAP. In case of any problem, the customers contacted me as their first
			level supporter. In addition to the management inside Exxon Mobil, sometimes I also had to contact third-parties regarding e.g. deliveries. My
			target countries were Norway, The United Kingdom and Ireland. During my work there was a six months long period where I took responsibility alone
			for more than a hundred stations.</p>
